🛡️ Smart-Attend: AI Face Recognition & Hardware Automation

Smart-Attend is a comprehensive, Raspberry Pi-based attendance solution that merges Deep Learning with IoT hardware. It doesn't just recognize faces; it manages entry via servo-controlled doors, provides real-time LCD feedback, and automates parent notifications using the Gmail API.

Key FeaturesReal-time Biometric Recognition: Uses state-of-the-art face encodings to identify students with high precision.
Hardware Control Hub: * Automated Entry: Controls a 90-degree servo motor to simulate door locking/unlocking upon successful identification.Visual Interface: Provides live status updates on a 16x2 I2C LCD screen.Audio Feedback: Greets recognized users by name using localized MP3 audio files.Smart Reporting Engine: * Automatically detects absences at a predefined "End of Day" hour.Sends automated alerts to guardians via OAuth 2.0 Gmail API integration.Secure Database Management: Maintains student profiles and timestamped attendance logs using an optimized SQLite schema.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: PythonAI/ML: face_recognition (dlib), OpenCV, NumPyDatabase: SQLite3Hardware Interface: RPi.GPIO, RPLCDAutomation: Google API Client, Pygame (Audio), Threading📁 System ArchitectureFileFunctionmain_app.pyThe central brain.
